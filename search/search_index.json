I started making this as a riff on Hummus but using Pinto beans instead of Chickpeas and using Mexican flavors. Ingredients 1 16 oz. can of refried Pinto beans (Vegetarian is what I used - not sure how important that is.) 1/2 tsp whole Cumin, toasted until fragrant then ground. 3 oz (by weight) sharp cheddar. 1 Jalapeno or equivalent, finely chopped. 1 Tbsp lemon juice. chopped fresh Cilantro for garnish. Process Heat the beans, cheese and ground Cumin in a microwave until warm enough to melt the cheese and mix well. (No reason not to heat on the stove top as long as you are attentive not to burn anything.) Add the chopped Jalapeno at any convenient time. Add the lemon juice after everything is blended and has cooled enough to not cook the juice. Serve Warm or chilled, sprinkle a lttle cfresh Cilantro on top and scoop with chips, crackers, etc. Options I usually make this with dry Pintos cooked in an Instant Pot and then drained completely. I reserve the liquid to add some while blending in a food processor to control the consistency. Starting with canned Pintos saves this step but limits the liquid additions or it turns into Pinto Bean Soup. 1 Jalapeno is probably a little light. I prefer to keep the heat light for the more sensitive audience (grandkids, wife, and others who may not appreciate the heat. It's not a contest.) When I start with dry beans and canned Jalapenos, I can add some liquid from the Jalapeno can to heat things up a bit more. Likewise with the Coriander. A little of that can go a long way. I would not hesitate to try other kinds of beans. Proportions are approximate. Consider them a starting point and add more or less to suit your taste. I should probably add a little salt.","title":"Bean Dip"},{"location":"food/bean-dip/#bean-dip","text":"Inspired by my love of Pinto beans and Hummus.

Contributing This description is licensed under Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal . I appreciate contributions including: pointing out typos identifying descriptions that are ambiguous or otherwise not clear identifying obvious or not so obvious errors or ommisions describing better ways to do any or all of this anything else that improves these instructions Particular areas that would benefit other ways to manage pool renaming usage for systems that employ EFI boot Contributions can be submitted as issues or pull requests or direct contact. I will credit any contributors here. Hank Barta - original version Sam Van den Eynde - clone w/out live environment and get renaming right The actual repo for this document is https://github.com/HankB/MkDocs-blog . Initial setup DEBIAN 11 (Bullseye) with ZFS on root following the instructions at https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/Getting%20Started/Debian/Debian%20Bullseye%20Root%20on%20ZFS.html# Constraints Old motherboard does not support UEFI boot. Current (target) install is on 500GB mirrored HDDs and using about 7% of capacity. The desire is to migrate to smaller SSDs (240GB SSDs.) Current install uses the bpool / rpool split as specified in the instructions referenced above. Plan Format and partition the target SSD as described in the instructions above. Create root and boot pools as described and named to match the original pools: rpool and bpool . zfs send | zfs recv the two filesystems from the existing install to the target SSD. Perform necessary rescue operations to make the target SSD bootable. These operations are being performed on a test system to minimize possible disruption with the \"real\" server until a working procedure is identified. Issues Pool naming was a continuing problem. With new pools given different names, the cache files were wrong and the pools would not import at boot. This is probably a solvable problem, but the solution eluded me during several tries. The first successful attempt was to create the new pools in the live environment and name them to match the existing (old) pools. The old pools could then be imnported using different names, the related filesystems transferred and the rescue operations completed. Execution (2023-03-10) Boot a Debian 11.6 live ISO (debian-live-11.6.0-amd64-gnome+nonfree.iso) using Ventoy. Install and start openssh-server and go into power settings to disable automatic suspend. Add contrib to /etc/apt/sources.list , updat and install ZFS.

Cache files for rpool and bpool exist and have the correct mount points ( /etc/zfs/zfs-list.cache/bpool ands /etc/zfs/zfs-list.cache/rpool ). The cache binary cache file /etc/zfs/zpool.cache appears to have the correct pool name but the wrong drive name. This does not seem to cause any problem. Exit the chroot. Unmount all /mnt/... mounts. zpool export -a exports bpool but not rpool which is apparently a known issue. Power down. Remove live boot media, disconnect the original boot drive(s) and reboot, selecting the new SSD in the BIOS settings. (If the original boot drive is still attached, the system may import the original rpool instead of the new rpool. ) On first boot from the new system, it may be necessary to zpool import -f rpool at the (initramfs) prompt. Alternatives zfs-discuss list user Sam Van den Eynde has described a procedure that does not require booting a live environment and manages the pool renaming issue that I struggled with in their email https://zfsonlinux.topicbox.com/groups/zfs-discuss/T536970860f9f34b4-Mb51bc8a885a9665639d79a13 Errata Despite renaming the pools on the original media, with the new SSD disconnected the original system booted but did not import the boot pool (now listed as bpool_old .) It was manually imported and given the original name name ( bpool ) and was automatically imported on subsequent boots. On the first try to boot the SSD with the original HDD still connected, the original root pool was imported as rpool and the new boot pool was imported as bpool . It seems likely that something in a cache file was pointing to the old root pool and that overrode the rename during the rescue operation.","title":"Debian Root on ZFS to a new drive"},{"location":"tech/Debian_ZFS_on_root_to_a_new_drive/#debian-root-on-zfs-to-a-new-drive","text":"","title":"Debian Root on ZFS to a new drive"},{"location":"tech/Debian_ZFS_on_root_to_a_new_drive/#motivation","text":"Old drives on a file server are old and decrepit and not long for this world.","title":"Motivation"},{"location":"tech/Debian_ZFS_on_root_to_a_new_drive/#contributing","text":"This description is licensed under Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal .

Motivation: I configured a recently received CM4 on a Mini Base and performed some intitial testing to establish correct operation. Initial tests produced lower than expected disk bandwidth. But there are confounding factors that could affect the tests. The initial test was performed with the SSD installed on an IO Board using a PCIe/NVME adapter and a CM4 with 8GB RAM. The card was then moved to the Mini Base which had a CM4 with 4GB RAM. Possible confounding factors. 4GB vs 8GB CM4 Cooling on the SSD due to mounting location. Debian vs. Ubuntu (Further comparisons were performed between Debian on the CM4/8GB and the CM4/4GB on the respective base boards.) Differing ZFS versions on the Debian vs. Ubuntu installations. Process Install vanilla Debian Bookworm to the 256GB NVME SSD. The same SSD will be used for all testing. It will be erased using blkdiscard prior to each installatioin and it will be trimmed prior to each disk benchmark. Perform two benchmarks on the CM4/4GB on the Mini Base.

Switch \"wing\" fastening Page 29 Block 2 shows \"switch wings\" being attached to the PCB via through holes and screws that threaded into drilled bosses in the plastic housing. There were two problems completing this assembly. The screws got progressively harder to drive while they still had about 1/8\" (3mm) exposed threads. It is normally a bad idea to continue to drive screws when they force to do so seems excessive. (That can result in broken parts or damaged threads and even broken screws.) While investigating this issue by checking hole depth with a small drill bit, it was discovered that one hole had not been drilled to the required depth. The first step for remediation was to select a drill bit that fit snugly into the holes and mark the required depth with a piece of tape. The hole was carefully drilled to the necessary depth. The screw for that hole was then fully inserted with force that seemed not quite excessive. (In other words, did not require any further techniques.) The second issue was easily avoided by heating the screws with a soldering iron for about 2 seconds to soften the plastic. Start the screws and drive until resistance seemed high (with the threads exposed as above.) Touch the soldering iron to the head of the screw for about 2 seconds. (*) Drive the screw almost the rest of the way in. Excess force while the screw is hot and the plastic soft would rip the threads out. Allow to cool before final tightening of the screws. Control crossover Once assembled the controls were connected to the base unit and the unit exercised. It was found that the two left control levers were cross connected and operating either control resulted on movememt from both motors. The control was disassembled and it appeared that slight scratches in the conformal coating on the printed curtcuit allowed a cross connection between the two switch butterflies for these controls. This was remediated by placing a strip of electrical tape across the area where the butterflies were fastened. It was necessary to remove a small patch of electrical tape around the screw holes to provide contact between the butterfly and printed circuit.

Step 1: Disk Formatting 1. Download and unpack the official image: curl https://gemmei.ftp.acc.umu.se/cdimage/unofficial/raspi//daily/raspi_4_bookworm.img.xz | xzcat >$(date +%Y%m%d)_raspi_4_bookworm.img 2. Dump the partition table for the image: sfdisk -d 20230901_raspi_4_bookworm.img resulting in hbarta@olive:~/Downloads/Debian_pi_root_ZFS$ sfdisk -d 20230901_raspi_4_bookworm.img label: dos label-id: 0x91e11d01 device: 20230901_raspi_4_bookworm.img unit: sectors sector-size: 512 20230901_raspi_4_bookworm.img1 : start= 8192, size= 1040384, type=c 20230901_raspi_4_bookworm.img2 : start= 1048576, size= 4071424, type=83 hbarta@olive:~/Downloads/Debian_pi_root_ZFS$ The required variables are then BOOT=1040384 ROOT=4071424 3. Create a partition script: cat > partitions << EOF label: dos unit: sectors 1 : start= 2048, size=$BOOT, type=c, bootable 2 : start=$((2048+BOOT)), size=$ROOT, type=83 3 : start=$((2048+BOOT+ROOT)), size=$ROOT, type=83 EOF 4. Connect the disk: In this case /dev/sdb , and create the necessary variables. DISK=/dev/sdb export DISKP=${DISK} 5. Ensure swap partitions are not in use: swapon -v (None in use.) 6. Clear old ZFS labels: sudo zpool labelclear -f ${DISK} (Secure erase or blkdiscard are alternate options for an SSD drive) sudo blkdiscard -f $DISK 7. Delete existing partitions: echo \"label: dos\" | sudo sfdisk ${DISK} sudo partprobe ls ${DISKP}* (Not needed when blkdiscard is used) 8. Create the partitions: sudo sfdisk $DISK < partitions 9. Loopback mount the image: IMG=$(sudo losetup -fP --show 20230901_raspi_4_bookworm.img) 10. Copy the bootloader data: sudo dd if=${IMG}p1 of=${DISKP}1 bs=1M 11. Clear old label(s) from partition 2: sudo wipefs -a ${DISKP}2 12. Copy the root filesystem data: # NOTE: the destination is p3, not p2. sudo dd if=${IMG}p2 of=${DISKP}3 bs=1M status=progress conv=fsync 13. Unmount the image: sudo losetup -d $IMG 14. If setting up a USB disk: This is where the Debian seems to differ from Ubuntu. zcat -qf on the installed image produces output that is bit for bit identical with the input. For now this will be left as is. Debian provides configuration options that will be set here. In particular root_authorized_key is necessary in order to SSH in later since Debian does not create a default user account. It is also convenient to set hostname at this time. sudo -sE MNT=$(mktemp -d /mnt/XXXXXXXX) mkdir -p $MNT/boot mount ${DISKP}1 $MNT/boot vi $MNT/boot/sysconf.txt # add public key as root_authorized_key umount $MNT/* rm -rf $MNT exit 15. Boot the Raspberry Pi. (Successful.) Step 2: Setup ZFS\uf0c1 1. Become root: Determine IP address of the Pi SSH in as root. 2. Set the DISK and DISKP variables again: DISK=/dev/sda DISKP=${DISK} 3. Install ZFS: Instructions differ with Ubuntu as ZFS modules must be built for Debian. vi /etc/apt/sources.list # add \"contrib\" repo apt update apt install pv zfs-initramfs console-setup locales dpkg-reconfigure locales zfs --version root@mercury:~# zfs --version zfs-2.1.11-1 zfs-kmod-2.1.11-1 root@mercury:~# 4.

I won't run one of these off an SD card as that's just not fast enough. My dream system for the Pi 4 is a compute module with a carrier that supports 4 SATA ports and has enough MMC to boot/root on. I've been preferentially running Debian on the one I use as a desktop. Raspberry Pi OS (R-Pi OS) is good enough for servers but I find the desktop too constraining. And I can't install my preferred desktop - Gnome - due to missing dependencies. I can install KDE and that's a whole 'nother discussion. I bounce back and forth between Bullseye (stable) and Bookworm (testing.) When I get bored of no drama on Bullseye I swap in an SSD that has Bookworm. I've submitted two bug reports so far, one of which was just closed this morning (2022-04-04.) Here are some tips for running Debian on a Pi 4B. The system will suspend just fine but I can't figure out how to unsuspend. The first thing I do on a new install is go into gnome settings and disable suspend. Then I tell Systemd and gnome not to suspend using the following commands. (Seems not to want to suspend with no DE installed.) sudo systemctl mask sleep.target suspend.target hibernate.target hybrid-sleep.target gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power sleep-inactive-battery-type 'nothing' gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power sleep-inactive-ac-type 'nothing' If you install Bookworm, hold the raspi-firmware package until the fixed firmware is in the Testing repo. ( apt-mark hold raspi-firmware ) Or install from experimental. Or install from the tagged version 1.20220331 . The default setting for Ethernet is \"unmanaged.\" It can be controlled using ifdown eth0 / ifup eth0 (but will be on again following the next reboot.) To let NetworkManager control, edit /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf and change managed=true to managed=false . I'm not sure this is a complete fix for this issue as Ethernet will be back on the next boot regardless of the setting. Status of Bookworm seems pretty shaky right now. I get frequent loss of connection to the SSD and the only recovery is to pull power. Loss of connection to the SSD can lead to file corruption and may be the reason that my Bookworm installations seem to deteriorate with time. Using an SSD. You will really want a powered USB hub for this. SSDs that worked fine with a Pi 3B may not work well with a 4B because USB 3 supports the faster UAS driver and in turn that causes the SSD to require more power. You can disable UAS using usb-storage.quirks but I prefer the faster faster speed that UAS provides. I use the Wavlink Model: WL-UH3042P1 and power the Pi off the quick charge port. It's rated for 2.4A so I plug other accessories (mouse, keyboard) into the hub along with the SSD to reduce the power demands from the Pi. Overclocking is relatively straight forward. On my Nullseye install I have added the following to /boot/firmware/config.txt arm_freq=2000 over_voltage=6 gpu_freq=750 And have stress tested using a variety of stressers. The CPU temperature goes up to about 82\u00b0C max. I would be concerned if I was running that kind of load at all times, but I'm not. * CPU case. I like the FLIRC cases a lot. Big hunk of aluminum with a molded in protrusion that contacts the CPU through a small pad and does a great job of drawing heat from the processor. It's compoletely passive so it won't stop working if a fan fails because there is no fan needed. Pi Zero, W, 2W and others Overlay FS and unattended-upgrades - No! I use some of these essentially as embedded systems so it seemed natural to employ the Overlay File System (R/O FS, Overlay FS) to reduce SD card failure. I run some of these on really cheap SD cards. I also prefer to keep unattended-upgrades installed to stay current with security upgrades. Unfortunately the two don't mix very well. The Overlay FS \"overlays\" the R/O FS with RAM so when apt-get update runs, it fills RAM with disk changes and results in \"no space on /\". On hosts that I have enabled Overlay RS, I have had to uninstall unattended-upgrades . I should look into PXE boot to see if systems that run from that can stay up to date and of course, not burn up SD cards. Unfortunately WiFi boot is problematic due to the need to establish an association before anything else can happen.","title":"Raspberry Pi"},{"location":"tech/Raspberry-Pi/#raspberry-pi","text":"","title":"Raspberry Pi"},{"location":"tech/Raspberry-Pi/#pi-4b","text":"Almost good enough to be a daily driver.

I bounce back and forth between Bullseye (stable) and Bookworm (testing.) When I get bored of no drama on Bullseye I swap in an SSD that has Bookworm. I've submitted two bug reports so far, one of which was just closed this morning (2022-04-04.) Here are some tips for running Debian on a Pi 4B. The system will suspend just fine but I can't figure out how to unsuspend. The first thing I do on a new install is go into gnome settings and disable suspend. Then I tell Systemd and gnome not to suspend using the following commands. (Seems not to want to suspend with no DE installed.) sudo systemctl mask sleep.target suspend.target hibernate.target hybrid-sleep.target gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power sleep-inactive-battery-type 'nothing' gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power sleep-inactive-ac-type 'nothing' If you install Bookworm, hold the raspi-firmware package until the fixed firmware is in the Testing repo. ( apt-mark hold raspi-firmware ) Or install from experimental. Or install from the tagged version 1.20220331 . The default setting for Ethernet is \"unmanaged.\" It can be controlled using ifdown eth0 / ifup eth0 (but will be on again following the next reboot.) To let NetworkManager control, edit /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf and change managed=true to managed=false . I'm not sure this is a complete fix for this issue as Ethernet will be back on the next boot regardless of the setting. Status of Bookworm seems pretty shaky right now. I get frequent loss of connection to the SSD and the only recovery is to pull power. Loss of connection to the SSD can lead to file corruption and may be the reason that my Bookworm installations seem to deteriorate with time. Using an SSD. You will really want a powered USB hub for this. SSDs that worked fine with a Pi 3B may not work well with a 4B because USB 3 supports the faster UAS driver and in turn that causes the SSD to require more power. You can disable UAS using usb-storage.quirks but I prefer the faster faster speed that UAS provides. I use the Wavlink Model: WL-UH3042P1 and power the Pi off the quick charge port. It's rated for 2.4A so I plug other accessories (mouse, keyboard) into the hub along with the SSD to reduce the power demands from the Pi. Overclocking is relatively straight forward. On my Nullseye install I have added the following to /boot/firmware/config.txt arm_freq=2000 over_voltage=6 gpu_freq=750 And have stress tested using a variety of stressers. The CPU temperature goes up to about 82\u00b0C max. I would be concerned if I was running that kind of load at all times, but I'm not. * CPU case. I like the FLIRC cases a lot. Big hunk of aluminum with a molded in protrusion that contacts the CPU through a small pad and does a great job of drawing heat from the processor. It's compoletely passive so it won't stop working if a fan fails because there is no fan needed.","title":"Pi 4B"},{"location":"tech/Raspberry-Pi/#pi-zero-w-2w-and-others","text":"Overlay FS and unattended-upgrades - No! I use some of these essentially as embedded systems so it seemed natural to employ the Overlay File System (R/O FS, Overlay FS) to reduce SD card failure. I run some of these on really cheap SD cards. I also prefer to keep unattended-upgrades installed to stay current with security upgrades. Unfortunately the two don't mix very well. The Overlay FS \"overlays\" the R/O FS with RAM so when apt-get update runs, it fills RAM with disk changes and results in \"no space on /\". On hosts that I have enabled Overlay RS, I have had to uninstall unattended-upgrades . I should look into PXE boot to see if systems that run from that can stay up to date and of course, not burn up SD cards. Unfortunately WiFi boot is problematic due to the need to establish an association before anything else can happen.","title":"Pi Zero, W, 2W and others"},{"location":"tech/Troubleshooting-Debian-root-on-ZFS/","text":"Troubleshooting Debian root on ZFS Motivation I'm sorry to hear that users are having difficulties with Debian root on ZFS. I've been running my laptop that way since I bought it in 2019 and have also converted my desktop to root on ZFS. More recently I've put my server on ZFS root. I can't say this has all been without problems, but I have been able to overcome any difficulties fairly easily. My goal with this document is to identify problems I've encountered and list the solutions I've employed. These notes are focused on inability to boot. I use Debian so the notes are specific to that.

The repo for this is at https://github.com/HankB/MkDocs-blog TL;DR Rescue Some times all that is needs is to import the pools from a prompt provided within the startup (e.g. enter the root password or hit <ctrl>D to continue I may not have the wording correct, but that is the gist of it.) Enter the root password and then manually import the root and boot pools. I ran into this recently when moving root and boot pools to another drive. It was the (initramfs) prompt and it was not necessary to enter the root password, just type zpool import -f rpool Hit <ctrl>D and the system comes up normally. I don't know why this happens, but the fix is easy. At other times the zfs import command will report that no modules are loaded and attempts to load them do not succeed. This could mean that the initramfs was not rebuilt or the modules themselves ere not rebuilt. Some kind of rescue is needed. Debian leaves the previous kernel in the boot menu and the next thing I do is reboot and select the previous kernel. That should bring up the system with no difficulties.

I have a CM4 Lite with WiFi and 8GB RAM. I have been testing this with the official R-Pi expansion board (Pi-EB) including booting from NVME. For my Raspberry Pi 4B devices I prefer to use pure Debian but it will not boot the CM4 if anything is connected to the PCIe slot so it is a non-starter. I have an ARM64 R-Pi OS image installed on a 256GB Kioxia (PCIe X1) NVME SSD that I plan to test with. The networking and NVME performance are the things I am most curious about. I may explore other areas such as USB boot and perhaps the connections for shutting down and booting the CM4. Baseline measurements I plan to use iperf3 and some common disk benchmarks to evaluate performance. Before swapping the CM4/heat sink and SSD to the CM4 Ether Board (CM4-EB) I'll complete the benchmarks on the Pi-EB. At this point I generally collect the time to complete the disk benchmarks as a first approximation of performance and will look at the detailed results if anything interesting comes up. Before proceeding I upgraded all available packages and this provides the kernel hbarta@cm4nvme:~ $ uname -a Linux cm4nvme 5.15.74-v8+ #1595 SMP PREEMPT Wed Oct 26 11:07:24 BST 2022 aarch64 GNU/Linux hbarta@cm4nvme:~ $ I have Gnome installed and will disable that for this testing since the CM4-EB has no video output.

Jumper wires used temporarily in place of switch. Instructions at https://www.alexwhittemore.com/raspberry-pi-cm4-using-nrpi_boot/ . Conclusion One of the most important attributes of the CM4 is that it exposes a PCIe lane on the connectors. The official IO Board routes this to a PCIe x1 slot and the @makerbymistake board brings this out directly to an NVME slot. This is an ideal board to use for a headless file server where Ethernet and NVME provide all of the I/O is needed. Other functions that depend only on Ethernet such as Pi-Hole could also be supported at full Gigabit Ethernet speed and all with a footprint a fraction of the space required for the official board. I also like that it is powered from a USB-C connector vs. the barrel used on the official board. I did not test the (micro) USB data connector but I understand that @makerbymistake has used it to run OctoPrint.","title":"dphacks CM4 Ether Board"},{"location":"tech/dphacks-CM4_Ether_Board/#dphacks-cm4-ether-board","text":"Expansion board for the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM4) that supports Ethernet, USB and PCIe/NVME SSD.

The official IO Board routes this to a PCIe x1 slot and the @makerbymistake board brings this out directly to an NVME slot. This is an ideal board to use for a headless file server where Ethernet and NVME provide all of the I/O is needed. Other functions that depend only on Ethernet such as Pi-Hole could also be supported at full Gigabit Ethernet speed and all with a footprint a fraction of the space required for the official board. I also like that it is powered from a USB-C connector vs. the barrel used on the official board. I did not test the (micro) USB data connector but I understand that @makerbymistake has used it to run OctoPrint.","title":"Conclusion"},{"location":"tech/data/benchmarks/","text":"CM4 benchmarks Results with the Raspberry Pi IO Board and CM4 Ether Board. 2022-10-31 Pi IO Board ping hbarta@cm4nvme:~ $ ping -c 10 olive ... --- olive.localdomain ping statistics --- 10 packets transmitted, 10 received, 0% packet loss, time 9042ms rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.146/0.191/0.227/0.024 ms hbarta@cm4nvme:~ $ hbarta@cm4nvme:~ $ hbarta@cm4nvme:~ $ ping -c 10 oak ... --- oak.localdomain ping statistics --- 10 packets transmitted, 10 received, 0% packet loss, time 9030ms rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.214/0.270/0.551/0.094 ms hbarta@cm4nvme:~ $ iperf iperf3 -s running on the server oak hbarta@cm4nvme:~ $ iperf3 -c oak --get-server-output --bidir Connecting to host oak, port 5201 ...

packages. Following installation the `raspi-firmware1 package was held due to performance probnlems with the upgrade. All testing was performed with the firmware that came with the install media. Initial tests were hampered by two issues. I had mistyped the WiFi password causing connection attempts to fail. Ethernet was unmanaged and remained configured even when physically disconnected. This masked WiFi even though WiFi appeared to be associated (wlan0 had an IP address handed out by the local DHCP server.) I got the Ethernet under NetworkManager control and retyped the password and achieved some success with WiFi. Ethernet seemed to work without difficulty with all kernels. Status I'm not happy with results, will retest when I have a chance (not till the weekend.) 5.15.0-2-arm64 This is the kernel that comes with the install media ( 20220121_raspi_4_bookworm.img.xz ). Linux up 5.15.0-2-arm64 #1 SMP Debian 5.15.5-2 (2021-12-18) aarch64 GNU/Linux No WiFi. dmesg capture at https://paste.debian.net/1236231/ No wlan0 in ip addr output. Ethernet seems to work OK. 5.16.0-5-arm64 This is the kernel available in the repo to upgrade following installation. Linux up 5.16.0-5-arm64 #1 SMP Debian 5.16.14-1 (2022-03-15) aarch64 GNU/Linux WiFi works w/out difficulty on both 5G and 2.4G APs. Switching repeatedly between the two SSIDs takes less than ten seconds. 5.17.0-rc8-arm64 Available from experimental Linux up 5.17.0-rc8-arm64 #1 SMP Debian 5.17~rc8-1~exp1 (2022-03-14) aarch64 GNU/Linux WiFi works on 5G, does not associate on 2.4G. Captured output to daemon.log when trying to switch from an associated 5G AP to a 2.4G AP up until NM re-requested the WiFi password. https://paste.debian.net/1236229/ Connect times to the 5G AP was quick at times and not quick other times. At one point it was necessary to turn WiFi off and on again to get it to associate. (Both 5G and 2.4G radios are on the same WiFi AP.) Did not shutdown cleanly. Had to pull power. 5.17.0-trunk-arm64 From experimental Linux up 5.17.0-trunk-arm64 #1 SMP Debian 5.17.1-1~exp1 (2022-03-29) aarch64 GNU/Linux Tested a second time and system hung. Hadn't remoted in - working from desktop. Happened once before and was unable to restart GDM and shutdown hung too. Was able to examine logs and dmesg output and saw nothing unusual but may not have been looking in the right place. Had to remove power both times. Both 5G and 2.4G WiFi seem to be working well. Switching back and forth between them seems timely. 2022-04-03 repeating testing Setup: Recent install of bookworm install media. xzcat 20220121_raspi_4_bookworm.img.xz> /dev/sdf Install raspi-firmware from unstable (direct download) and network-manager and full upgrade of all bookworm packages. apt upgrade -y wget http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/pool/non-free/r/raspi-firmware/raspi-firmware_1.20220328+ds-1_arm64.deb apt install ./raspi-firmware_1.20220328+ds-1_arm64.deb apt install network-manager Instructions for testing/managing WiFi using CLI HankB_, yes, from the command line, first, turn the wifi device on \"nmcli radio wifi on\" then list the wifi connections \"nmcli dev wifi list\", then sudo nmcli dev wifi connect network-ssid password \"network-password\" Test with 5.17.0-trunk-arm64 (ssh in via Ethernet) root@charm:~# nmcli radio wifi on root@charm:~# nmcli dev wifi list IN-USE BSSID SSID MODE CHAN RATE SIGNAL BARS SECURITY 70:4F:57:11:58:63 Nacho24 Infra 6 130 Mbit/s 100 **** WPA2 10:C3:7B:55:05:E8 Giant Voice System Infra 10 195 Mbit/s 97 **** WPA2 10:C3:7B:55:05:E9 NRO-33 Infra 10 195 Mbit/s 97 **** WPA2 70:4F:57:11:58:62 Nacho5G Infra 149 270 Mbit/s 77 *** WPA2 10:C3:7B:55:05:EC Fanghorn Forest Infra 157 405 Mbit/s 77 *** WPA2 root@charm:~# nmcli dev wifi connect \"Fanghorn Forest\" password \"elided\" Device 'wlan0' successfully activated with 'elided'. root@charm:~# ip addr 1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000 link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00 inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever inet6 ::1/128 scope host valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever 2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000 link/ether dc:a6:32:bf:65:b5 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff inet 192.168.1.103/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global dynamic eth0 valid_lft 5209sec preferred_lft 5209sec inet6 2601:249:1680:36f0:dea6:32ff:febf:65b5/64 scope global dynamic mngtmpaddr valid_lft 86390sec preferred_lft 14390sec inet6 fe80::dea6:32ff:febf:65b5/64 scope link valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever 3: wlan0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000 link/ether dc:a6:32:bf:65:b6 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff inet 192.168.1.164/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute wlan0 valid_lft 7194sec preferred_lft 7194sec inet6 2601:249:1680:36f0::1a72/128 scope global dynamic noprefixroute valid_lft 7197sec preferred_lft 4497sec inet6 2601:249:1680:36f0:dd52:e503:3685:cb27/64 scope global dynamic noprefixroute valid_lft 86397sec preferred_lft 14397sec inet6 fe80::add9:ac99:37f5:fddb/64 scope link noprefixroute valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever root@charm:~# root@charm:~# root@charm:~# root@charm:~# ifdown eth0 Killed old client process Internet Systems Consortium DHCP Client 4.4.2-P1 Copyright 2004-2021 Internet Systems Consortium.

Motivation While provisioning the new CM4 it was noted that many IoT devices were droppinig from the LAN including TP-Link Kasa lights and outlets and Raspberry Pi Zeroes. This is not unusual, particularly the TP-Link devices, but it seemed that nearly half of the devices were disconnected and that is unusual. At that time I thought to turn off the radio on the new CM4 and discovered that wlan0 did not appear in the output of ip addr . These may or may not be related. The milestones I can recall before taking a step back to investigate WiFi were: Install a NVME SSD with a copy of R-Pi OS (which has not been used for a while) on the Ether Board https://hankb.github.io/MkDocs-blog/tech/dphacks-CM4_Ether_Board/ , attach the new CM4 to the board and boot. The board was connected to my LAN via Ethernet. Find the device on my LAN and SSH in. I discovered that this install was R-Pi OS and wanted to use Debian for this system so I recorded the output of ip addr and shut the system down. (I needed the MAC addresses for Ethernet and WiFi to remap to avoid later confusion.) Install the most recent \"tested Debian\" build on the card including some additional setup. The image installed was 20230612_raspi_4_bookworm.img.xz downloaded from https://raspi.debian.net/tested-images/ Completed initial configuration using the Ansible Playbooks at https://github.com/HankB/polana-ansible . Continued configuration and noticed that many devices on my IoT LAN were disconnected from my Access Point (AP.) I power cycled the AP and that did not seem to help. I was concerned about possible RF interference from the new CM4 since it was located about 1 foot from the AP. I was not planning on using WiFi so I thought to disable that radio in case it was the cause of the WiFi issues. That was when I noticed that ip addr no longer displayed a device wlan0 . At this point I began a less than systematic exploration of the \"missing wlan0 \" situation. Before I describe that, I'll list the CM4 related equipment I'm using. CM4 Lite with WiFi/Ethernet and 8GB RAM. I have been using this for quite a while now. I will call it the \"CM4/8GB\" in the following discussion. Official Raspberry Pi IO Board (on which the CM4/8GB is presently mounted.) PCIe/NVME adapter on which I can mount an NVME SSD and boot either R-Pi OS or Debian. CM4 Lite with WiFi/Ethernet and 2GB RAM. This is recently acquired. Dphacks Ether Board. I used the CM4/8GB on this for initial testing and confirmed that everythging I tested (including WiFi) worked as expected. When I received the CM4/2GB, I installed it on this board and proceeded with configuration. 256GB KIOXIA NVME SSD which (along with an NVME/USB adapter) I used for initial configuration and plan to use for further testing. 128GB SK Hynix NVME SSD on which is installed a fully updated and overclocked 64 bit R-Pi OS. This was used during the initial exploration but will not be used for the more systematic testing. initial exploration I performed the following steps, not necessarily in the listed order, to tryt to isolate the issue. I did not record each step as I tested, hence the need to retest. Also I used existing installations which had been customized includinig overclocking. Swap the 128GB SSD to the Ether Board/CM4/2GB and boot. Confirm that wlan0 does not appear in ip addr . Confirm that there are no messages that include wlan0 or wifi in dmesg output. Confirm that there are Bluetooth (BT) related messages in dmesg output. The common factor hewre is the CM4/2GB and Ether Board. I believe I checked for (and found) wlan0 with the CM4/8GB in the IO Board and running R-Pi OS from the 128GB SSD. Install the 256GB SSD (Debian) on the IO Board with the CM4/8GB. The wlan0 device was not present. The common factor here is the S/W. At this point I saw the need to perform a more systematic investigation to try to narrow down the reason for the missing wlan0 (and possible related WiFi issues.) Test with pristine R-Pi OS image (2023-05-03-raspios-bullseye-arm64-lite.img.xz.) No joy here. On first boot it loops in keytboard configuration and I cannot find a way to bypass that. I booted R-Pi OS (old installation) from SD card and wlan0 is not present, but wifi is disabled in /boot/config.txt . Commented that out, rebooted and still no wlan0 but I could have done something erlse like blacklisting the modules. Undid that and wlan0 is present and appears to be working (obtained IP addr using DHCP.) I wrote the same image to an SD card and was able to boot w/out any issue. And the wlan0 device was present. The next test is to copy the SD card to the NVME SSD and boot from that. Image initialized on an SD card and copied to NVME SSD booted CM4/8GB/IO Board w/out difficulty and wlan0 was present. Transferred the NVME SSD to the CM4/2GB/Ether Board. System booted, logged in and found that wlan0 was present. Performed an upgrade (still on CM4/2GB/Ether Board) and rebooted. wlan0 still present. In other words, on both H/W setups, wlan0 was present. Next series involves testing with Debian 20230612_raspi_4_bookworm.img.xz . No joy. Does not boot from NVME. Debugging that is an issue outside the scope of this investigation. 20230101_raspi_4_bookworm.img.xz seems to be hanging at the same place. Copy 20230612_raspi_4_bookworm.img.xz to the NVME SSD and try to boot the CM4/8GB/IO Board. Hung <ctrl><alt><del> led to a halted system. Repeated power cycles resulted in the same result.

It came up to the point where it reported mmc0: Timeout waiting for cmd interrupt (whichj has been fixed in subsequent kernels.) Working with this variant was abandoned (and later resumed.) Copy 20230612_raspi_4_bookworm.img.xz to an SD card and attempt boot on CM4/8GB/IO Board. Boot completes and results in a login prompt on the console. ip addr lists only lo and eth0 . Installed pciutils and usbutils . lspci lists nothing. lsusb lists 2 hubs and a keyboard. Copy 20230101_raspi_4_bookworm.img.xz to another SD card and boot. Repeatedly comes up with the mmc0: Timeout waiting for cmd interrupt but recollection from previous testing is that this does not happen 100% of the time. After 4 unsuccessful boots (requiring power cycling) the OS came up normally and presented a login prompt. The wlan0 device was not present. Conclusion This appears to be a S/W issue. R-Pi OS in the most recent version (based on Bullseye) brings up wlan0 on the CM4/8GB/IO Board reliably. Recent versions of Debian (Bookworm) do not. The problems with other devices on my local LAN seem to be unrelated. Future Determine why wlan0 is not coming up on Debian Bookworm. This is not a high priority as I do not plan to use WiFi at present. I would nevertheless be willing to test if someone can point me in the right direction. Determine why Debian Bookworm does not boot from NVME. The interesting thing is that using my playbook to copy the image to the boot media and tweaking a few other things results in a system that does boot. One thing the playbook does is to resize the root partition (and creates an extra partition for ZFS) and that may bypass the boot problem. Test with Buster and Testing to see if results are different. Determine why R-Pi OS loops on keyboard configuration when booting from NVME SSD. Also not a high priority but if someone in a position to fix this is interested, I'd be happy to test.","title":"New Raspberry Pi CM4 WiFi testing"},{"location":"test-debug/Pi-new-CM4-WiFi-debugging/#new-raspberry-pi-cm4-wifi-testing","text":"Explore WiFi on recently acquired Raspberry Pi Compute Module Lite with WiFi and Bluetooth.","title":"New Raspberry Pi CM4 WiFi testing"},{"location":"test-debug/Pi-new-CM4-WiFi-debugging/#motivation","text":"While provisioning the new CM4 it was noted that many IoT devices were droppinig from the LAN including TP-Link Kasa lights and outlets and Raspberry Pi Zeroes.

Also not a high priority but if someone in a position to fix this is interested, I'd be happy to test.","title":"Future"},{"location":"test-debug/Pi-CM4-PCIe/Pi_CM4_PCIe_testing/","text":"Pi CM4 PCIe testing Purpose Test Debian Bookworm on a Pi CM4 with (and booting from) an NVME adapter and two SATA adapters in the \"Compute Module 4 IO Board\" Results as of 2023-03-28 NVME with SSD System boots from NVME and works as expected. The system will not boot from SD card when the PCIe/NVME adapter is installed. ASMedia PCIe/SATA adapter Boot from SD card works 3-4 times out of 5. Other times halts with a blank screen following the \"rainbow screen.\" When a SATA SSD is connected (when booting from SD) it appears to work. Boot from SSD was unsuccessful. The \"rainbow screen\" did not appear but the subsequent (BIOS) screen looping through possible boot modes ( NETWORK and BCM-USB-MSD ) At some point something was printed to the serial port but it looked like a single character at the wrong baud rate. Many times the system was power cycled with both SD card in place and SSD connected and the result was a blank screen and no serial output. Once the system came up and appeared to boot from the SD card and find root on the SSD. After sevaral tries I duplicated that and captured the serial output. root@cm4iob:~# lspci -v 00:00.0 PCI bridge: Broadcom Inc. and subsidiaries BCM2711 PCIe Bridge (rev 20) (prog-if 00 [Normal decode]) Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0, IRQ 23 Bus: primary=00, secondary=01, subordinate=01, sec-latency=0 Memory behind bridge: 00000000-000fffff [size=1M] [32-bit] Prefetchable memory behind bridge: [disabled] [64-bit] Capabilities: [48] Power Management version 3 Capabilities: [ac] Express Root Port (Slot-), MSI 00 Capabilities: [100] Advanced Error Reporting Capabilities: [180] Vendor Specific Information: ID=0000 Rev=0 Len=028 <?> Capabilities: [240] L1 PM Substates Kernel driver in use: pcieport 01:00.0 SATA controller: ASMedia Technology Inc.
