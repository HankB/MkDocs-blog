# Bean Dip

Inspired by my love of Pinto beans and Hummus. I started making this as a riff on Hummus but using Pinto beans instead of Chickpeas and using Mexican flavors.

## Ingredients

* 1 16 oz. can of refried Pinto beans (Vegetarian is what I used - not sure how important that is.)
* 1/2 tsp whole Cumin, toasted until fragrant then ground.
* 3 oz (by weight) sharp cheddar.
* 1 Jalapeno or equivalent, finely chopped.
* 1 Tbsp lenon juice.
* chopped fresh Cilantro for garnish.

## Process

1. Heat the beans, cheese and ground Cumin un a mycowave until warm enough to melt the cheese and mix well. (No reason not to heat on the stove top as long as you are attentive not to burn anything.)
1. Add the chopped Jalapeno at any convenient time.
1. Add the lemon juice after everything is blended and has cooled enough to not cook the juice.

## Serve

Warm or chilled, sprinkle a lttle cfresh Cilantro on top and scoop with chips, crackers, etc.

## Options

* I usually make this with dry Pintos cooked in an Instant Pot and then drained completely. I reserve the liquid to add some while blending in a food processor to control the consistency. Starting with canned Pintos saves this step but limits the liquid additions or it turns into Pinto Bean Soup.
* 1 Jalapeno is probably a little light. I prefer to keep the heat light for the more sensitive audience (grandkids, wife, and others who may not appreciate the heat. It's not a contest.) When I start with dry beans and canned Jalapenos, I can add some liquid from the Jalapeno can to heat things up a bit more. Likewise with the Coriander. A little of that can go a long way.
* I would not hesitate to try other kinds of beans.
* Proportions are approximate. Consider them a starting point and add more or less to suit your taste.
* I should probably add a little salt.
