# Peach Cobbler from scratch

## Result

TBD - WIP

## Motivation

Canonical recipe (box cake mix and canned peaches) results on dessert that is just too swet for me. First ingredient on the box mis is sugar. It should be possible to make a replacement for the box mix that is sufficiently sweet and makes a good cobbler. Canned peaches (or other fruit) also provide sweetness.

## Canonical recipe

TODO

## trials

Strategy is to search for various recipes that do not use box mix and then try them out with varying amounts of sugar. To get accurate proportions the quantities specified in the recipe will be weighed and then a fraction of the original weight will be used to make a batch. To further simplify the process, the mix will be "baked" in the microwave with a small portion of peach mix and a pt of butter. This should be sufficiently close for the purpose of the evaluation.
