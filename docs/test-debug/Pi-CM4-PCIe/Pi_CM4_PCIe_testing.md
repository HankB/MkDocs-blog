# Pi CM4 PCIe testing

## Purpose

Test Debian Bookworm on a Pi CM4 with (and booting from) an NVME adapter and two SATA adapters in the "Compute Module 4 IO Board"

## Results as of 2023-03-28

### NVME with SSD

System boots from NVME and works as expected. The system will *not* boot from SD card when the PCIe/NVME adapter is installed.

### ASMedia PCIe/SATA adapter

Boot from SD card works 3-4 times out of 5. Other times halts with a blank screen following the "rainbow screen." When a SATA SSD is connected (when  booting from SD) it appears to work.

Boot from SSD was unsuccessful. The "rainbow screen" did not appear but the subsequent (BIOS) screen looping through possible boot modes (`NETWORK` and `BCM-USB-MSD`) At some point something was printed to the serial port but it looked like a single character at the wrong baud rate.

Many times the system was power cycled with both SD card in place and SSD connected and the result was a blank screen and no serial output. Once the system came up and appeared to boot from the SD card and find root on the SSD. After sevaral tries I duplicated that and captured the [serial output.](./minicom-SD_boot-SSD_root.cap.txt

### Marvel PCIe/SATA adapter

Unable to boot from SD card when this adapter is in the PCIe slot. The "rainbow screen" appears and the screen goes blank with no further (on screen) behavior. With no SD card in the slot, the firmware cycles through boot options until it gets to PXE boot and then repeats the cycle.

With the SD card removed and a bootable SSD connected to the adapter, the "rainbow screen" does not appear and there is no output to the serial port.

Card dettails (from R-Pi OS)

## 2023-03-28 Serial debug

Serial connection worked with the boot image but produced no output for the Marvell adapter. There was no change with the changes listed below despite power cycling it repeatedly.

Comments per `kibi` on `#debian-raspberrypi`

```text
<kibi> if the kernel doesn't boot, and if it doesn't very early, nearly no chances of getting logs stored onto the internal FS (or external SD card), since / is unlikely to be mounted at this stage
<kibi> anyway:
<kibi> early_con â†’ /etc/default/raspi-extra-cmdline
<kibi> printf "enable_jtag_gpio=1\nforce_turbo=1\n" >> /etc/default/raspi-firmware-custom
<kibi> printf CONSOLES=\"ttyS1,115200\" >> /etc/default/raspi-firmware
```

## 2023-03-29 focus on SD boot failure when PCIe card is present

### Marvell PCIe/SATA adapter

Successful boot [dmesg](./dmesg-SD-Debian-ASMedia_successful.txt) and [serial](./minicom-SD-Debian-ASMedia_success.cap.txt)

## TODO

* ~~Report more information on the PCIe/SATA adapters.~~
* ~~Report `dmesg` output for various combinations (where boot was successful.)~~
* ~~Perform serial debug for "didn't boot" scenarios.~~
* ~~Search for tweaks to boot CM4 from PCIe/SATA.~~
